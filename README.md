## Introduction

The **OBC Subsystem** plays a critical role in the spacecraft’s mission by managing and controlling overall operations. This repository includes the preliminary design and documentation that have been prepared for the **Preliminary Design Review (PDR)**. The materials in this repository are focused on initial design considerations and operational concepts that will be further refined as the project progresses.

## File Overview

This repository contains the following key files for the OBC subsystem that are part of the **PDR phase**:

- **Data Budget**: A document outlining the preliminary resource allocations, including computational, memory, and power budgets for the OBC.
- **Comparison Matrix (Satellite Bus DJF)**: A matrix comparing various satellite bus configurations in terms of performance metrics and suitability for the mission.
- **Concept of Operations Flowchart**: A flowchart illustrating the high-level operational concept for the OBC subsystem and its interactions with other subsystems.
- **State Diagram Matrix**: A matrix showing the different states the OBC subsystem may transition through during the mission, supporting the preliminary CONOPS.

## Details of Key Files

### Data Budget

The **Data Budget** file provides an early estimate of the resource allocations for the OBC subsystem, including computational resources, memory, and power consumption. This budget helps ensure that the subsystem will meet performance and power constraints as the design evolves.

### Comparison Matrix (Satellite Bus DJF)

The **Comparison Matrix (Satellite Bus DJF)** compares different satellite bus configurations, examining key parameters such as payload capacity, power consumption, and overall reliability. This comparison will aid in selecting the optimal bus configuration for the mission as the design progresses through subsequent phases.

### Concept of Operations Flowchart

The **Concept of Operations (CONOPS) Flowchart** outlines the initial operational flow of the OBC subsystem, describing how it will interact with other subsystems in the spacecraft. This high-level flowchart serves as a foundational document for refining the OBC’s role as the design matures.

### State Diagram Matrix

The **State Diagram Matrix** models the potential states of the OBC subsystem throughout its operational lifecycle, including normal operation and failure modes. This matrix provides a framework for understanding the OBC's behavior during various phases of the mission and helps guide testing and verification activities.
